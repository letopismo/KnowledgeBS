To avoid this message use the dpkg command as follows:
dpkg --list | grep nginx
dpkg --list | more

List all installed packages only
The apt command displays both installed and packages available to install. What if you want to list currently installed software only? Fear not, pass the option to the apt command:
apt list --installed
