List:
You can show everything with:

sudo apt-get update


Remove:
ref: https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed

Use the --remove flag, similar to how the PPA was added:

sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:whatever/ppa
You can also remove PPAs by deleting the .list files from /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.

As a safer alternative, you can install ppa-purge:

sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
And then remove the PPA, downgrading gracefully packages it provided to packages provided by official repositories:

sudo ppa-purge ppa:whatever/ppa
Note that this will uninstall packages provided by the PPA, but not those provided by the official repositories. If you want to remove them, you should tell it to apt:

sudo apt-get purge package_name
Last but not least, you can also disable or remove PPAs from the "Software Sources" section in Ubuntu Settings with a few clicks of your mouse (https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removedno terminal needed).
