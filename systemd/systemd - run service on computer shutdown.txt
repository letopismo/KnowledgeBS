[Unit]
Description=Service to commit changes to remote git repo
DefaultDependencies=no
Before=shutdown.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/home/alexor2/Documents/KnowledgeBase/ci-scripts/systemd_service_push2repo.sh
TimeoutStartSec=0

[Install]
WantedBy=shutdown.target



The suggested solution is to run the service unit as a normal service - have a look at the [Install] section. So everything has to be thought reverse, dependencies too. Because the shutdown order is the reverse startup order. That's why the script has to be placed in ExecStop=.

The following solution is working for me:

[Unit]
Description=...

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=true
ExecStop=<your script/program>

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
RemainAfterExit=true is needed when you don't have an ExecStart action.

After creating the file, make sure to systemctl daemon-reload and systemctl enable yourservice --now.
