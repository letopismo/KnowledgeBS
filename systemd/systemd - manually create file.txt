systemd - create manually files
ref: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/599809/what-are-systemd-runtime-unit-files-for

You can customize timers and unit files with
sudo systemctl edit unit/timer
to add some things to the original file or

sudo systemctl edit --full unit/timer

to completely edit the unit file or timer.


Run 'systemctl edit --force --full unit-push2git.service' to create a new unit.
