see envvars:
show-environment
Dump the systemd manager environment block. This is the environment block that is passed to all processes the manager spawns. The environment block will be dumped in straightforward form suitable for sourcing into most shells. If no special characters or whitespace is present in the variable values, no escaping is performed, and the assignments have the form "VARIABLE=value". If whitespace or characters which have special meaning to the shell are present, dollar-single-quote escaping is used, and assignments have the form "VARIABLE=$'value'"
  
Reload the service files to include the new service.
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start-Stop-Restart-Status

sudo systemctl status example.service
$ sudo systemctl start foo-daemon
$ sudo systemctl stop foo-daemon
$ sudo systemctl restart foo-daemon
$ systemctl status foo-daemon

-l: don't truncate entries with ellipses (...)
--no-pager can be added to avoid invoking a pager when the output is an interactive terminal.

See global service logs:
$ sudo journalctl -q  -u basic_test_service

or user service logs:
journalctl -q  --user-unit

journalctl --user-unit SERVICENAME works fine even with storage set to volatile. But any of -u SERVICENAME, --user -u SERVICENAME or --user --user-unit SERVICENAME do not work with volatile storage, 
 "journalctl --user -u SERVICENAME"
should just work as you think. On older versions you have to use
"--user --user-unit=SERVICENAME" instead.

or in all logs:
sudo journalctl  -xe

To enable your service on every reboot
sudo systemctl enable --now example.service

To disable your service on every reboot
sudo systemctl disable example.service
