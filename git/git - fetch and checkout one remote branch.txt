git clone --single-branch

- option to limit clining to a single branch; tags that do not point into the history of the branch are not fetched.

Git actually allows you to clone only one branch, for example:

git clone -b mybranch --single-branch git://sub.domain.com/repo.git

how to clone other branches?

you can tell git to pull all branches like this:

git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"
git fetch origin

if you want to add a single branch, you can do the following:

git remote set-branches --add origin [other-remote-branch]
git fetch origin [remote-branch]:[local-branch]

This  adds multiple fetch = lines to .git/config, very handy when you want to switch between two branches on the remote but not fetch a whole bunch of other branches.

you can also use wildcard for [remote-branch], e.g.

git remote set-branches --add origin release-1.*
git fetch 
git checkout release-1.5
