rs - unwrap_or and unwrap_or_else
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56726571/

Question:

fn main() {
    let _one = None.unwrap_or("one".to_string());
    let _two = None.unwrap_or_else(|| "two".to_string());
}


Solution:
Both are evaluated during the program's execution and can be arbitrary values. The difference is that:

With unwrap_or the fallback value is evaluated just before unwrap_or is called, and therefore is evaluated whether it's needed or not (because Rust is an eager language).
With unwrap_or_else the fallback value is evaluated only when unwrap_or_else triggers it (by invoking the function you pass), and therefore is evaluated only if it's needed.
