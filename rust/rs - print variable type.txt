If I had checked the type of "hello world" with gdb's ptype command, I would have noticed that it's an object and not a number or a pointer.

(gdb) ptype "hello world"
type = struct &str {
  data_ptr: u8 *,
  length: usize,
}
To resolve this, change the argument to the string's property called data_ptr.

(gdb) ptype "hello world".data_ptr
type = u8 *

(gdb) p "hello world".data_ptr
$14 = (u8 *) 0x101100080 "hello world\000"
