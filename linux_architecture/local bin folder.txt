~/.local/bin

This is defined in systemd's standard which has the following to say about the directory's contents:

    Executables that shall appear in the user's $PATH search path. It is recommended not to place executables in this directory that are not useful for invocation from a shell; these should be placed in a subdirectory of ~/.local/lib/ instead. Care should be taken when placing architecture-dependent binaries in this place, which might be problematic if the home directory is shared between multiple hosts with different architectures.

Depending on your distribution, you might have to add the directory to your path by putting this in your ~/.bashrc:

PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
