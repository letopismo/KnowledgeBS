$XDG_DATA_HOME defines the base directory relative to which user-specific data files should be stored. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is either not set or empty, a default equal to $HOME/.local/share should be used.

example:

    Application data files, such as databases, configuration files, and user preferences
    Media files, such as images, videos, and audio recordings
    Document files, such as text documents, spreadsheets, and presentations
    Data files created by scripts or other custom applications
