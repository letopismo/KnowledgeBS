Depending on the exact string you're searching, the \V prefix will probably do the trick.
See :help \V:

after:    \v       \m       \M       \V         matches ~
                'magic' 'nomagic'    
          $        $        $        \$         matches end-of-line
          .        .        \.       \.         matches any character
          *        *        \*       \*         any number of the previous atom
          ()       \(\)     \(\)     \(\)       grouping into an atom
          |        \|       \|       \|         separating alternatives
          \a       \a       \a       \a         alphabetic character
          \\       \\       \\       \\         literal backslash
          \.       \.       .        .          literal dot
          \{       {        {        {          literal '{'
          a        a        a        a          literal 'a'
So if I have a string hello.*$world, I can use the command /\V.*$ to find just .*$ -- the only part of the string that should need escaping is another backslash, but you can still do grouping, etc., by escaping the special symbol.
