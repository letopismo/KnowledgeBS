nvim fix unable clipboard

CTRL +SHIFT + C does not copy to systemclibarod

check:
nvim --version

:help clipboard
:echo has('clipboard')
1

:echo has('unnamedplus')
0

so I check that native integration with systemclipboard exist

$ nvim -v                                                                                                                                         ✔  9s 
