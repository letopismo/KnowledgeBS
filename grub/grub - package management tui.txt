This is almost exactly the same as What do I select for “GRUB install devices” after an update? - or perhaps it isn't, hence asking, as I'm running Ubuntu on a Virtualbox machine via Vagrant.

I was unable to update packages, so I ran sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade. It appeared with the following message:

Assuming you're not using UEFI, and I see no reason as to why you should be. Also assuming you didn't set it up in some fancy pancy way originally, then yes, the first option is the correct one. By selecting /dev/sda it will be installed to the MBR of /dev/sda, which a BIOS should be able to boot.

Anser:
I've had this come up recently with my vagrant box, but selecting that option then informed me that I apparently chose not to install GRUB to any disk. I could tell the install process I didn't want to go through without installing GRUB, but then I got bumped back to the 'select a disk' screen mentioned in the original post. Took me too long to realise I was supposed to use the spacebar to select/asterisk the selection before going on.. So if anyone else is having this issue, this is probably why you're seeing that notification. /supersmartuser.

ou have to press the space bar to actually select the item. When it's selected, you'll see an * asterisk appear in the box. Then hit "enter" and it will start installing.
